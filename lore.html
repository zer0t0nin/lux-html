      <div class="parahead">Luxanna Crownguard's Lore</div>

      <div class="parabody">
        Luxanna—or Lux, as she prefers to be called—grew up in the Demacian city
        of High Silvermere, along with her older brother Garen. They were born
        to the prestigious Crownguard family, which had served for generations
        as protectors of the kings of Demacia. Their grandfather saved the
        king’s life at the Battle of Storm’s Fang, and their aunt Tianna was
        named commander of the elite Dauntless Vanguard regiment before Lux was
        born.
        <br />
        <br />
        Garen took to his family’s role with fervor, joining the military when
        he was still little more than a boy. Lux, in his absence, was expected
        to help run the family’s many estates—a task she resented, even as a
        young child. She wanted to explore the world, to see what lay beyond the
        walls and borders of Demacia. She idolized Garen, but railed against his
        insistence that she put her own ambitions aside.
        <br />
        <br />
        To the endless frustration of Lux’s tutors, who sought to prepare her
        for a life of dutiful service to the Crownguard family, she would
        question their every teaching, examine differing perspectives, and seek
        out knowledge far beyond what they were prepared for. Even so, few could
        find it in themselves to stay angry at Lux, with her zest for life and
        intoxicating optimism.
        <br />
        <br />
        Little did any of them know a time of change was approaching. Magic had
        once brought Runeterra to the brink of annihilation, and Demacia had
        been founded as a place where such powers were forbidden. Many of the
        kingdom’s folktales told of pure hearts turned dark by the lure of
        magic. Indeed, Lux and Garen’s uncle had been slain by a rogue mage some
        years earlier.
        <br />
        <br />
        And there were fearful whispers, rumors from beyond the great mountains,
        that magic was rising once more in the world…
        <br />
        <br />
        Riding home one fateful night, Lux and her horse were attacked by a
        ravenous sabrewulf pack. In a moment of fear and desperation, the young
        girl let loose a torrent of magical light from deep within her, routing
        the beasts but leaving her shivering in fear. Magic, the terror of
        Demacian myths, was as much a part of Lux as her Crownguard lineage.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fear and doubt gnawed at her. Would she become evil? Was she an
        abomination, to be imprisoned or exiled? At the very least, if her
        powers were discovered, it would see the Crownguard name disgraced
        forever. With Garen spending more time away from High Silvermere, Lux
        found herself alone in the halls of their family home. Still, over time,
        she became more familiar with her magic, and her sleepless nights—fists
        clenched, willing her inner light to fade—became fewer and fewer. She
        began experimenting in secret, playing with sunbeams in the courtyards,
        bending them into solid form, and even creating tiny, glowing figures in
        her palm. She resolved to keep it a secret, as much as she could.
        <br />
        <br />
        When she was sixteen, Lux traveled with her parents Pieter and Augatha
        to their formal residence in the Great City of Demacia, to witness
        Garen’s investiture into the honored ranks of the Dauntless Vanguard.
        <br />
        <br />
        The city dazzled Lux. It was a monument to the noble ideals of the
        kingdom, with every citizen protected and cared for; and it was there
        that Lux learned of the Illuminators, a charitable religious order
        working to help the sick and the poor. Between her family’s courtly
        engagements, she became close with a knight of the order named Kahina,
        who also taught Lux more martial skills, sparring and training with her
        in the gardens of the Crownguard manor.
        <br />
        <br />
        Spending more time in the capital, Lux has finally begun to learn about
        the wider world—its diversity, and its history. She now understands that
        the Demacian way of life is not the only way, and with clear eyes she
        can see her love for her homeland standing alongside her desire to see
        it made more just… and perhaps a little more accepting of mages like
        her.
