        Lux is a character from the videogame "League of Legends". I started
        playing this game about more than a year ago and I main her. She's one
        of the first champions that I learned to play and I enjoy playing to
        this day. I would say that this game in particular has made a huge
        impact in my life for the past year, It gave me something to distract
        myself a bit in these difficult times. Playing Lux made me happy during
        the days that I am down, so I dedicate this to her and this game.
